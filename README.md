# Fine-Tuning BERT for Text Summarization

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of fine-tuning BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for extractive text summarization. The objective is to train BERT to identify and extract the most relevant sentences from a given text to generate concise summaries.

## Dataset
We use a public text summarization dataset from Kaggle:
[Text Summarization Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lusfernandotorres/text-summarization-with-large-language-models/input)

## Model Architecture
BERT is a transformer-based model that is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. For extractive summarization, BERT is fine-tuned to classify sentences based on their importance in the given document.

### Fine-Tuning Process
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Tokenization using Hugging Face's `BertTokenizer`.
  - Sentence segmentation and encoding.
  - Labeling sentences for extractive summarization.

- **Training:**
  - Model: `bert-base-uncased` from Hugging Face Transformers.
  - Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss (explained in the notebook).
  - Optimizer: AdamW.
  - Learning Rate Scheduler: Linear decay with warm-up steps.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Loss tracking during training.
  - Summarization performance comparison using ROUGE-N and ROUGE-L scores.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch nltk rouge-score
```

## Running the Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bert-text-summarization.git
cd bert-text-summarization
```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook BERT.ipynb
```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, fine-tune BERT, and evaluate the model.

## Results
- **Loss Analysis:**
  - Training loss is reported for each epoch.
- **Sample Summaries:**
  - Example original text and predicted summaries are displayed.
- **Comparison:**
  - Summary quality is compared using ROUGE scores.

## Future Improvements
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
- Compare results with abstractive models like GPT-2 and LLaMA.
- Deploy the trained model as an API for real-world usage.
